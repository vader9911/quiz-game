# <Quiz-Game>

## Description

This project is a multiple-choice style game to quiz you on web developement topics such as HTML, CSS and javaScript.

## Development

While creating this project I encountered multiple challenges, mostly relating to implemnting the logic and using javascript syntax. I first laid out 3 "cards" that included the start, middle, and end of game screens. I then tried to write all  the questions in the HTML. Then I realized that I could most likely do this in JavaScript. While I got it to work, It required a lot of research on my part to troubleshoot issues that arose. My main issue was getting the script to generate the HTML needed. I struggled with the syntax of adding classes and IDs to the new elements. Evnetually It was figured out and I was able to move on to more of the game logic. 

I learned a lot about JS in this project and I was not even able to implement all features.

The following is still needed:
- Scoreboard function and previous scores.
- Randomization of quiz order.
- A way to restart the quiz without refresh.
- Styling
- Better validation of conditionals.

## Usage

    A multiple-choice style game to quiz you on web developement topics such as HTML, CSS and javaScript! To play the game, press the START button to start the quiz and the countdown timer. Answer the question presented to move on but choose carefully as an incorrect answer will subtract time from the timer. The game will end when all questions are correctly answered or the timer runs out. Your score is the remaining time.
